1. dashboard that shows u analysis of your data based on  a predefined template(i.e we already have logic which determines what all charts will be shown)
---works on their dataset and any dataset of the same layout (anything having exactly same 20 columns and semantics)
----basically our analyze.py is clustering in the moment and not using a pretrained model
-----------a policy report would be cool too
----------this thing just shows u charts for your data
----------it's still worthy of more thought



2.AI based analysis engine: analyses any data according to a predefined flexible analysis strategy (an AI assisted version of expert systems)
-----------this looks doable to me


3.A context aware educational counsellor(can analyse student data of any shape ,according to a predefined flexible analysis strategy and can also answer user queries about the data )
---somewhere down the line it can execute new code too**** however that comes with a couple of asterisks
--------doable but should think about it after option 2


4.Interactive dashboard:
u take user data and use it to train models(not using pretrained models)
basically u take their data ,find centroids on them, weights for mayank's model also (this too works for data of same shape)
then you offer the following features:
-----analysis of their data based on academic trajectory , 8 feature clustering
(the charts we discussed)
-----a button showing "Show Gender wise analysis"
-----another button showing "show school wise analysis"
-----a simulator where you can do this:
find how much is the increment in Exam_Score if we tweak the 16 features (increase some by 10% , decrease other by 1 unit)
and a better way to do this is to do it schoolwise

-----i also have something in mind for this part " early signs of disengagement" but dunno where to fit that





--------------------would be really cool if we connect our app to the student database or have a csv that has Student_ID
then we can do so much more
like making a spatial map where every student is a datapoint projected in 2d space , when user clicks on any of them , the students 8 feature spider chart along with insights on helping them are generated
and then dbscan can also be used to find the outliers and see their specific situation, this way we can do anamoly detection and analysis too
or how abt we give ids to students in our existing dataset






i feel Interactive dashboard is our best option for now
