we have 2 models :
a 8 feature based 5 persona model
a 2 feature based 3 cluster model

gender hasn't been used anywhere , once all models are ready we will anlayse genderwise results too , if we find something useful

we can give results for raw csv
we can give school wise summaries


how do we do this
Early signals of disengagement or struggle
